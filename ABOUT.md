Application: Hotel Offers
=========================

What to accomplish?
-------------------

* This app aims to provied a simple site that consumes JSON API as a server-side call and displays deals in an appealing manner.
it has back-end responsiple for preparing the query parmeters sent by the user from the interface, then query for hotel deals, then displays them in a view.

Why Java?
---------

* In the application I used Java language for back-end, and HTML, Javascript for front-end, using Java has no specific reason except that my experience lies in it, although there is no such a thing in java called "magic method" like PHP yet java is solid engineering.
Maybe other languages is better dealing with JSON such as Node.js, but I took learning time in consideration according to the task.

What was the new things I learned?
----------------------------------

It was the first time I used Heroku.

My Experiance?
